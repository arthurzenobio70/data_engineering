## üèóÔ∏è Part 2: Connect to Snowflake (10 minutes)

### Step 5: Get Your Snowflake Information

1. **Log into Snowflake** in your web browser
2. **Look at the URL** - copy the part before `.snowflakecomputing.com`
   - Example: If URL is `https://abc123.snowflakecomputing.com`, your account is `abc123`
3. **Note your username and password**

### Step 6: Create Configuration File

**Windows Users:**
```bash
# Create the config folder
mkdir %USERPROFILE%\.dbt

# Create the config file
notepad %USERPROFILE%\.dbt\profiles.yml
```

**Mac/Linux Users:**
```bash
# Create the config folder
mkdir -p ~/.dbt

# Create the config file
nano ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
```

### Step 7: Add Your Snowflake Details

**Copy and paste this into the file, then replace the YOUR_* parts:**

```yaml
finance_data_platform:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE      # Example: abc123
      user: YOUR_USERNAME_HERE        # Your Snowflake username
      password: YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE    # Your Snowflake password
      role: ACCOUNTADMIN
      database: FINANCE_DB_DEV
      warehouse: COMPUTE_WH
      schema: raw
      threads: 4
      client_session_keep_alive: False
      query_tag: dbt-dev
  target: dev
```

**Save the file and close the editor**

### Step 8: Test Your Connection

```bash
# Test if everything is connected
dbt debug
```

**‚úÖ Success Check:** You should see `Connection test: [OK connection ok]`

**‚ùå If it fails:** Double-check your account name, username, and password

## üè¢ Part 3: Create Your Data Infrastructure (15 minutes)

### Step 9: Set Up Infrastructure with Terraform

```bash
# Go to the terraform folder
cd terraform

# Copy the example settings
copy terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars     # Windows
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars       # Mac/Linux
```

### Step 10: Edit Terraform Settings

**Open the file in your text editor:**
```bash
notepad terraform.tfvars     # Windows
nano terraform.tfvars        # Mac/Linux
```

**Edit these lines with your information:**
```hcl
# Replace these with your actual details
environment = "dev"
project_name = "finance-data-platform"
owner = "your-name"

snowflake_account = "YOUR_ACCOUNT.snowflakecomputing.com"
snowflake_username = "YOUR_USERNAME"
snowflake_password = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
snowflake_role = "ACCOUNTADMIN"
```

**Save and close the file**

### Step 11: Build Your Infrastructure

```bash
# Initialize terraform
terraform init

# See what will be created
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

# Create everything (type 'yes' when asked)
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

**This will take 2-3 minutes and create databases, warehouses, and users in Snowflake**

**‚úÖ Success Check:** You should see `Apply complete!` message

## üìä Part 4: Add Your Data (10 minutes)

### Step 12: Upload Sample Data

1. **Log into Snowflake** in your web browser
2. **Click on "Data" ‚Üí "Databases"**
3. **Find and click "FINANCE_DB_DEV"**
4. **Click on "RAW" schema**
5. **You'll see 4 empty tables:** customers, orders, order_items, products

### Step 13: Load Data into Each Table

**For each table, do this:**

1. **Click on the table name** (e.g., "CUSTOMERS")
2. **Click "Load Data" button**
3. **Upload the matching CSV file** from your `Data_Files` folder:
   - customers table ‚Üê upload `customers.csv`
   - orders table ‚Üê upload `orders.csv`
   - order_items table ‚Üê upload `order_items.csv`
   - products table ‚Üê upload `products.csv`
4. **Use these settings:**
   - File format: CSV
   - Skip first line: Yes (checked)
   - Click "Load"

**Repeat for all 4 tables**

### Step 14: Verify Data Loaded

**In Snowflake, run this query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;   -- Should show about 100 rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;      -- Should show about 300 rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_items; -- Should show about 800 rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;    -- Should show about 50 rows
```

## üöÄ Part 5: Run the Data Pipeline (5 minutes)

### Step 15: Go Back to Command Line

```bash
# Navigate back to main project folder
cd ..
```

### Step 16: Run the Complete Data Pipeline

```bash
# Build all the data models
dbt run
```

**This will take 2-3 minutes and create all your analytics tables**

```bash
# Test data quality
dbt test
```

**This runs 50+ quality checks on your data**

```bash
# Generate documentation
dbt docs generate
```

**‚úÖ Success Check:** You should see messages like "Completed successfully"

streamlit run monitoring/data_quality_dashboard.py
```

**A web page will open at:** `http://localhost:8501`

**You'll see:**
- Data quality metrics
- Test results
- Freshness monitoring

### Step 18: View Documentation

**Open a new command prompt/terminal and run:**
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd dbt_snowflake_project

# Activate environment
dbt-env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
source dbt-env/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

# Start documentation server
dbt docs serve --port 8002
```

**Open your browser to:** `http://localhost:8002`

**You'll see:**
